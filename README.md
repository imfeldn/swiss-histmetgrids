# swiss-histmetgrids
This repository contains the code for creating daily high-resolution (1x1 km) historical grids for Switzerland from 1763 to 2020 for the following variables:
Daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, relative sunshine duration, daily mean and minimum relative humidity, uv-wind at 10m
The reconstruction is based on the analogue resampling method and data assimilation.

The code is organized in two folders:
Folder #1 recon_txtnsd
This folder contains all the scripts needed to reconstruct and evaluate maximum and minimum temperature, and relative sunshine duration.
Folder #2 recon_wsrh
This folder contains all the scripts needed to reconstruct and evaluate uv-wind compenents and relative humidity.
