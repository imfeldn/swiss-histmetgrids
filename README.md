# swiss-histmetgrids
This repository contains the code for creating daily high-resolution (1x1 km) historical meteorological grids for Switzerland from 1763 to 2020 based on early instrumental data.
The reconstruction is based on the analogue resampling method and data assimilation. 
The code is organized in two folders:
Folder #1 recon_txtnsd
This folder contains all the scripts needed to reconstruct and evaluate maximum and minimum temperature, and relative sunshine duration.
Folder #2 recon_wsrh
This folder contains all the scripts needed to reconstruct and evaluate uv-wind compenents and relative humidity.
